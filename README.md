# YouTube-Downloader
This is a program that will download a  youtube video from a given link. I created this because I was travelling on a plane recently and was struck with an intense wave of boredom. I realized if there was some way I could download youtube videos without using youtube premium, I would solve my problem. Thankfully I was able to create this program which perfectly fixed my problem. To run the code, navigate to the folder that has dowload.py using the terminal. Then run the code with the youtube link. It will look something like this python3 download.py "The link of the video you want to download".
